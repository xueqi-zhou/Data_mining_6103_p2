# Data_mining_6103_p2
I am going to explore how python is related to job. There are three major parts for my project. They are data extraction, data preprocessing and data visualization. I am going to extract job information from indeed. Firstly, I load 400 pages to get the job URL. we find 1625 job from the 400 pages. Next, we want to extract job title, location, and job description. For convenience, I convert the job description into lower case, so it will be easier to us to do the further analysis. In data preprocessing part, I combine all the information I extracted before into dataframe for my further cleaning. we find that the most job we extract is from virginia.
